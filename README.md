# mocaccino

I reorganized the repository taking inspiration from the various tastes and elaborations of the mocaccino.

## please note

For many, the term mocaccino means a delicious preparation that has Italian espresso coffee as its main ingredient. 
A chocolate flavored variant of espresso stained with milk heated with steam.
In this case, I'm just joking with my last name. In the term mocaccino I see only a kind of funny metamorphosis.
